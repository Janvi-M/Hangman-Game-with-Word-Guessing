# Hangman-Game-with-Word-Guessing

This C++ program implements a classic Hangman game where players can either guess the entire word or guess individual letters. The game starts by randomly selecting a word from a file ("words.txt"). Players have a limited number of tries (7 in this case) to correctly guess the word or reveal all its letters by guessing individual letters.

Features:
Random selection of a word from a file.
Players can choose to guess the entire word or guess individual letters.
Correctly guessed letters are revealed in the word.
Incorrect guesses reduce the number of remaining tries.
The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word or runs out of tries.
Displays a congratulatory message upon winning or informs the player of their loss.
Provides the correct word at the end of the game.
Includes welcoming and exiting messages for a friendly user experience.
This project provides a fun and interactive way to play the Hangman game in the console, incorporating both word and letter guessing functionalities.
